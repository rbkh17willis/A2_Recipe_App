<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This project focuses on creating a web application using the Django framework. 
  Django has the advantage of being neatly moduralized and developer friendly, while also being powerful enough to run some of the world’s most popular websites. 
  In this project, working with Python-based Django, a full-stack web application using the Django development server will be developed. 
  The main focus of this project will be the backend with a light touch of styling on the frontend. 
  The final web application will be dynamic and multi-user, letting users sign up and create their own content. 
  It’ll also have statistical dashboards, implementing new data analytics and data visualization skills.
